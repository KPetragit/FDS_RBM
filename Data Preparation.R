### Household members size

### Washington Group Index
#Disability status identifiers are calculated based on guidelines by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics for over 5-year-olds. Note that in FDS we have three levels of disability level (some difficulty, a lot of difficulty, cannot do at all).


#Conditions for different disability identifiers:
  
#Category 1: any domain = 1, 2 or 3

#Category 2: at least two domains = 1 or at least one domain = 2 or 3

#Category 3: at least one domain = 2 or 3

#Category 4: at least one domain = 3

#The WG recommends using category as the indicator for disability status.

#Step 1: Sum disability cases across domains

  mutate(disabilitySeverity1_count = rowSums(
    select(., all_of(c("Dis_03", "Dis_06", "Dis_09", "Dis_12", "Dis_15", "Dis_18"))) == 1, #looking at disability level 1 = Some difficulty
    na.rm = TRUE))
# "disabilitySeverity1_count" represents the number of domains with disability severity 1 (some difficulty).

hhroster <- hhroster %>%
  mutate(disabilitySeverity2_count = rowSums(
    select(., all_of(c("Dis_03", "Dis_06", "Dis_09", "Dis_12", "Dis_15", "Dis_18"))) == 2, #looking at disability level 2 = A lot of difficulty
    na.rm = TRUE))
# "disabilitySeverity2_count" represents the number of domains with disability severity 2 (A lot of difficulty).

hhroster <- hhroster %>%
  mutate(disabilitySeverity3_count = rowSums(
    select(., all_of(c("Dis_03", "Dis_06", "Dis_09", "Dis_12", "Dis_15", "Dis_18"))) == 3, #looking at disability level 3 = Cannot do at all
